## Status

Unified Consciousness Field Dynamics (UCFD) is a complete, falsifiable physical framework.  
It does not replace existing physics. It tests a single, sharply defined extension:

> Whether persistent informational structure exerts measurable dynamical influence beyond standard physical evolution.

If the predicted effects are absent, the framework collapses cleanly to standard physics.

---

## Ontological Boundary (Non-Empirical)

An ontology motivated by UCFD is presented in `ONTOLOGY.md`.

The physical framework **does not depend on ontological assumptions**.  
All empirical claims stand or fall independently.

Ontology is conditional, downstream, and constrained by experimental outcome.

---

## Abstract

Unified Consciousness Field Dynamics (UCFD) introduces a single Lorentz-scalar field, \( C(x) \), coupled exclusively to persistent, low-entropy informational structure \( K_s(x) \), defined via coarse-grained entropy curvature at a system’s dominant physical correlation length.

The framework makes one testable claim:

> Sustained internal informational organization produces small but measurable corrections to physical dynamics.

If no such corrections exist, the coupling constant \( \varepsilon \rightarrow 0 \), and UCFD reduces exactly to standard theory.

## 1. Minimal Interpretive Postulate

- Awareness is the minimal condition for observation.
- Awareness is non-dynamical and carries no information.
- This postulate introduces **no testable claims** and functions solely as an interpretive boundary.

All predictive content arises independently.

---

## 2. Consciousness as a Dynamical Regime

Consciousness is defined operationally, not phenomenologically.

It corresponds to awareness engaged in **sustained, structured informational activity**.

Functional modes:
- **Thinking:** generation and manipulation of distinctions
- **Imagination:** relational and spatial structuring of information
- **Memory:** stabilization of informational persistence
- **Self-reflection:** recursive informational closure

Consciousness corresponds strictly to **persistent, self-reinforcing informational organization**.  
No claims are made about subjective experience.

## 3. Physical Formulation

### 3.1 Field Definition

Introduce a minimal scalar field \( C(x) \):

\[
\mathcal{L}_C = \frac{1}{2} \partial_\mu C \partial^\mu C
- \frac{1}{2} m_C^2 C^2
\]

### 3.2 Interaction

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \varepsilon \, C(x)\, K_s(x)
\]

### 3.3 Total Lagrangian

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} =
\mathcal{L}_{\text{standard}} +
\mathcal{L}_C +
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}
\]

The coupling constant \( \varepsilon \) is bounded solely by experiment.

---

## 4. Structured Information Measure

- Define coarse-grained entropy density \( s(x) \) at the system’s dominant correlation length.
- Define informational curvature:

\[
K_s(x) = \nabla^2 s(x)
\]

Properties:
- \( K_s(x) \) acts only as a source term
- It is not directly observable
- It vanishes in equilibrium, random, or unstructured systems

---

## 5. Dynamical Regimes

- **Transient structure:** fluctuating \( K_s(x) \Rightarrow \) transient \( C(x) \)
- **Persistent structure:** sustained \( K_s(x) \Rightarrow \) bounded solutions \( C_S(x) \)

These bounded solutions define **Self-Reinforcing Informational Modes (SRIMs)**.

> A system is conscious if and only if it occupies a SRIM.

This criterion is strictly dynamical.

---

## 6. Quantitative Predictions

For any measurable physical rate \( \Gamma \):

\[
\Gamma_{\text{total}} =
\Gamma_{\text{standard}} +
\delta \Gamma_{\text{UCFD}}
\]

With leading-order correction:

\[
\delta \Gamma_{\text{UCFD}} \propto
\varepsilon^2 \langle K_s K_s \rangle
\]

All deviations vanish continuously as \( \varepsilon \rightarrow 0 \).

---

## 7. Explicit Experimental Predictions

### 7.1 Quantum Coherence Test (Primary)

**System:** Superconducting qubit arrays  
**Observable:** Decoherence rate \( \Gamma \)

**Protocol:**
- Compare two systems with identical energy, temperature, geometry, and noise
- Vary only sustained informational organization (logical depth, feedback, memory persistence)

**Prediction:**
\[
\delta \Gamma \sim \varepsilon^2 \int d^4x \, \langle K_s(x) K_s(0) \rangle
\]

**Falsification:**  
No statistically significant difference → \( \varepsilon \rightarrow 0 \)

---

### 7.2 Collective Mode Stability Test

**System:** Photonic lattices or optomechanical arrays  
**Observable:** Phase-locking duration \( \tau \)

**Protocol:**
- Structured vs unstructured driving signals
- Identical power spectra and energy input

**Prediction:**
\[
\delta \tau \propto \varepsilon^2 \langle K_s^2 \rangle
\]

---

### 7.3 Low-Frequency Noise Anomaly Test

**System:** High-coherence mesoscopic systems  
**Observable:** Non-thermal low-frequency noise

**Prediction:**
Excess noise correlated with informational persistence, not energy throughput.

---

## 8. Falsification Envelope

UCFD is falsified if:

- No deviation is observed in systems sustaining persistent informational structure
- Experimental bounds force \( \varepsilon \) below physically relevant scales

No post-hoc parameter adjustment is permitted.

Null results in low-coherence or short-duration systems do not meaningfully test the framework.

---

## 9. Conditional Interpretive Consequences

UCFD makes no metaphysical claims directly.

If its predictions are confirmed, then:

- Information is causally real
- Persistent structure is dynamically relevant
- Conscious organization alters physical evolution

These conclusions follow **by exclusion**, not assertion.

If UCFD is falsified, no ontological claims are supported.

---

## 10. Scope

UCFD does not complete physics.

It bridges:
- Physical dynamics
- Information theory
- Conscious organization

Its scope is narrow, explicit, and testable.
