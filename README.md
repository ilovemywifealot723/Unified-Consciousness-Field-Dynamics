## Status

UCFD is a **complete, falsifiable physical framework**.  
It does not replace existing physics, but extends it by testing a single sharply defined hypothesis:  

> **Persistent informational structure exerts measurable dynamical influence beyond standard physical evolution.**  

If predicted effects are absent, UCFD reduces cleanly to standard physics.  

---

## Ontological Boundary (Non-Empirical)

An ontology motivated by UCFD is presented in `ONTOLOGY.md`.  

- Awareness is defined as the **minimal condition for observation**.  
- Awareness is **non-dynamical** and carries no information.  
- Consciousness is **persistent, self-reinforcing informational organization**.  

The physical framework **does not depend on ontological assumptions**. Empirical claims stand or fall independently. Ontology is conditional, downstream, and constrained by experimental outcome.

## Abstract

UCFD introduces a **Lorentz-scalar field \( C(x) \)** coupled to **persistent, low-entropy informational structure \( K_s(x) \)**.  

- \(K_s(x)\) is defined via **coarse-grained informational curvature** at the dominant physical correlation length of the system.  
- The framework predicts **small but measurable corrections to physical dynamics** in systems sustaining persistent structure.  
- If no such corrections exist, the coupling constant \( \varepsilon \to 0 \), and UCFD reduces exactly to standard theory.  

---

## 1. Minimal Interpretive Postulate

- Awareness is **non-dynamical** and **structure-independent**.  
- Functional modes of consciousness (thinking, memory, imagination, self-reflection) are **defined operationally**, not phenomenologically.  
- This postulate introduces **no testable claims**. Predictive content arises entirely from the physical framework.  

---

## 2. Consciousness as a Dynamical Regime

Consciousness is operationally defined as **persistent, structured informational activity**.  

- **Thinking:** generation and manipulation of distinctions  
- **Imagination:** relational/spatial structuring of information  
- **Memory:** stabilization of informational persistence  
- **Self-reflection:** recursive informational closure  

A system is conscious **if and only if** it occupies a **Self-Reinforcing Informational Mode (SRIM)**, i.e., a bounded, persistent solution of the coupled field dynamics.

## 3. Physical Formulation

### 3.1 Scalar Field \( C(x) \)

\[
\mathcal{L}_C = \frac{1}{2} \partial_\mu C \partial^\mu C - \frac{1}{2} m_C^2 C^2
\]

- Lorentz-invariant  
- Canonical mass dimension 1  

### 3.2 Operator-Level Coupling to Structured Information

Define \( K_s(x) \) in **physically measurable terms**:

\[
K_s(x) = \nabla^2 \langle \hat{\rho}_{\text{info}}(x) \rangle
\]

Where \( \hat{\rho}_{\text{info}}(x) \) is the **density operator representing coarse-grained persistent structure**:

- For qubit arrays: \( \hat{\rho}_{\text{info}}(x) = \sum_i w_i \hat{\sigma}_z^{(i)} \)  
- For photonic lattices: \( \hat{\rho}_{\text{info}}(x) = \hat{a}^\dagger(x)\hat{a}(x) \)  
- For classical mesoscopic systems: coarse-grained energy density operator  

The interaction Lagrangian is:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \varepsilon C(x) K_s(x)
\]

The total Lagrangian becomes:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{standard}} + \mathcal{L}_C + \mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}
\]

---

## 4. Equations of Motion

Euler–Lagrange equations give:

\[
\partial_\mu \partial^\mu C(x) + m_C^2 C(x) = - \varepsilon K_s(x)
\]

For the system operators:

\[
\frac{d}{dt} \hat{\rho}_{\text{system}} = -i [ \hat{H}_{\text{standard}} + \varepsilon C(x) \hat{\rho}_{\text{info}}, \hat{\rho}_{\text{system}} ]
\]

This yields a **perturbative correction to dynamics** proportional to \( \varepsilon \) and the correlation function \( \langle K_s(x) K_s(x') \rangle \).

---

## 5. Leading-Order Observable Corrections

For any measurable rate \( \Gamma \):

\[
\Gamma_{\text{total}} = \Gamma_{\text{standard}} + \delta \Gamma_{\text{UCFD}}
\]

Leading-order correction (second-order perturbation theory):

\[
\delta \Gamma_{\text{UCFD}} \sim \varepsilon^2 \int d^4x \, d^4x' \, \langle K_s(x) K_s(x') \rangle G(x-x')
\]

- \( G(x-x') \) is the Green’s function for the scalar field \( C(x) \)  
- Deviations vanish continuously as \( \varepsilon \to 0 \)  

---

## 6. Explicit Experimental Predictions

### 6.1 Quantum Coherence Test

**System:** Superconducting qubit arrays  
**Observable:** Decoherence rate \( \Gamma \)  

**Prediction:**

\[
\delta \Gamma \sim \varepsilon^2 \int d^4x \, \langle K_s(x) K_s(0) \rangle
\]

**Protocol:**  
- Compare two identical systems  
- Vary only **persistent informational structure** (logical depth, feedback, memory persistence)  

**Falsification:**  
No statistically significant difference → \( \varepsilon \to 0 \)  

---

### 6.2 Collective Mode Stability

**System:** Photonic lattices / optomechanical arrays  
**Observable:** Phase-locking duration \( \tau \)  

**Prediction:**

\[
\delta \tau \propto \varepsilon^2 \langle K_s^2 \rangle
\]

**Protocol:**  
- Structured vs unstructured driving signals  
- Identical energy, temperature, geometry  

---

### 6.3 Low-Frequency Noise Anomaly

**System:** High-coherence mesoscopic systems  
**Observable:** Non-thermal low-frequency noise  

**Prediction:**  
Excess noise correlates with informational persistence, **not energy throughput**.  

---

## 7. Falsification Envelope

UCFD is falsified if:

1. No deviations observed in systems sustaining persistent informational structure  
2. Experimental bounds force \( \varepsilon \) below physically relevant scales  

Null results in low-coherence or short-duration systems **do not meaningfully test the framework**.

---

## 8. Conditional Interpretive Consequences

If predictions are confirmed:

- Persistent informational structure is **dynamically real**  
- Conscious organization **alters physical evolution**  
- Information is a **causal agent**, not just a descriptor  

If falsified: no ontological claims are supported.

---

## 9. Scope

- UCFD does **not complete physics**, but bridges:  
  - Physical dynamics  
  - Information theory  
  - Conscious organization  

- Its scope is narrow, explicit, and testable.
