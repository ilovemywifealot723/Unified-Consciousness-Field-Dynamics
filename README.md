## Note

The project evolved rapidly from an initial doorway model into a complete, internally consistent, and falsifiable framework. All commits are documented. This release represents the current complete version of the framework and remains open to future refinement without loss of falsifiability.

---

## Ontological Background

The philosophical ontology motivating UCFD is stated explicitly in [ONTOLOGY.md](./ONTOLOGY.md).

The physical framework presented here stands or falls independently by experimental falsification and does not rely on the ontology for empirical validity.

## Abstract

Unified Consciousness Field Dynamics (UCFD) is a minimal, falsifiable extension of standard physics. It introduces a single Lorentz-scalar field, C(x), which couples exclusively to persistent low-entropy informational structure K_s(x), defined objectively via coarse-grained entropy density at a system’s dominant physical correlation length.

The framework asks a sharply defined question: do sustained internal informational organizations exert measurable dynamical influence beyond standard Hamiltonian evolution? All predictions collapse cleanly if no such influence exists (ε → 0).

## 1. Ontological Postulate

- Awareness is the minimal condition for observation.
- Awareness is non-dynamical and does not carry information.
- This postulate introduces no empirical claims and functions solely as an interpretive boundary condition.

---

## 2. Consciousness as a Dynamical Regime

Consciousness is defined operationally as awareness engaged in structured informational activity.

Functional decompositions:
- **Thinking:** manipulation of information
- **Imagination:** relational and spatial structuring of information
- **Memory:** stabilized informational persistence
- **Self-reflection:** recursive informational closure

Consciousness corresponds strictly to sustained, self-reinforcing informational modes. These definitions are operational and specify informational regimes only; they do not assert phenomenological content.

## 3. Physical Reformulation

- Introduce C(x): a minimal dynamical field sensitive to stable informational organization.
- Free-field Lagrangian:  
  L_C = 1/2 ∂_μ C ∂^μ C − 1/2 m_C² C²
- Interaction term:  
  L_int = ε C(x) K_s(x)
- Total Lagrangian:  
  L_total = L_standard + L_C + L_int
- The coupling constant ε is bounded by null experimental results.

---

## 4. Structured Information Measure

- Define coarse-grained entropy density s(x) at the dominant physical correlation length.
- Informational curvature:  
  K_s(x) = ∇² s(x)
- K_s(x) functions strictly as a source term and is not directly observable.

---

## 5. Dynamical Regime

- Fluctuating K_s(x) → transient C(x) responses.
- Persistent K_s(x) → bounded, self-reinforcing solutions C_S(x) (SRIMs).
- A system is conscious if and only if it occupies a SRIM.

---

## 6. Empirical Predictions

Deviations from standard theory arise only when structured information is sustained, including:

- Modified decoherence rates
- Low-frequency noise anomalies
- Phase stability deviations
- Persistence of collective modes

Candidate experimental platforms include:
- Superconducting qubits
- Photonic lattices
- Atom interferometers
- Optomechanical systems
- Resolved neural assemblies

---

## 7. Falsification Criteria

- Measured rate:  
  Γ_total = Γ_standard + δΓ_UCFD
- Predicted correction:  
  δΓ_UCFD ∝ ε² ⟨K_s K_s⟩
- If δΓ_UCFD = 0, then ε → 0 and the framework collapses.
- No post-hoc parameter adjustment is permitted.

Note on Experimental Sensitivity: Full validation requires long-duration, high-precision experiments on systems capable of sustaining persistent, structured informational structures. Null results from low-coherence or short-duration setups do not meaningfully falsify the framework.

---

## 8. Interpretive Consequences (Conditional)

UCFD makes no metaphysical claims directly. However, if its empirical predictions are confirmed, then ontologies in which structured informational organization is strictly epiphenomenal, causally inert, or reducible to passive description become incompatible with physical evidence.

In that case, interpretations in which awareness and information are treated as structurally fundamental are no longer optional metaphysical additions, but represent the minimal coherent accounts consistent with observed dynamics.

This implication arises by exclusion rather than assertion. UCFD does not prove any ontology; it constrains the space of viable interpretations consistent with empirical results.
