**Note:**
The project evolved rapidly from a minimal falsifiable doorway model to a complete, fully-defined framework. All commits are documented; this release represents the official final version

## Ontological Background
The philosophical ontology underlying UCFD is stated explicitly in [ONTOLOGY.md](./ONTOLOGY.md).  
The physical framework stands or falls independently by experimental falsification.

## Abstract
UCFD is a minimal, falsifiable extension of standard physics. It introduces a single Lorentz-scalar field, C(x), which couples exclusively to persistent low-entropy informational structure (K_s(x)), defined objectively via coarse-grained entropy density at the system’s dominant physical correlation length. The framework asks a sharply defined question: do structured internal organizations exert dynamical influence beyond standard Hamiltonian evolution? All predictions collapse cleanly if no such influence exists (ε → 0).

## 1. Ontological Postulate
- Awareness is the minimal condition for observation.
- Awareness is non-dynamical and does not carry information.
- This postulate makes no empirical claim; it underpins the operational framework without introducing metaphysical assumptions.

---

## 2. Consciousness as a Dynamical Regime
- Consciousness = awareness engaged in structured information activity.
- Operational definitions:
  - Thinking = manipulation of information
  - Imagination = relational/spatial structuring of information
  - Memory = stabilized informational persistence
  - Self-reflection = recursive closure
- Consciousness corresponds strictly to sustained, self-reinforcing informational modes.

---

## 3. Physical Reformulation
- Introduce C(x): minimal dynamical field detecting stable informational organization.
- Free-field Lagrangian: L_C = ½ ∂_μ C ∂^μ C − ½ m_C² C²
- Interaction: L_int = ε C(x) K_s(x)
- Total: L_total = L_standard + L_C + L_int
- ε is bounded by null results in high-coherence experiments.

---

## 4. Structured Information Measure
- Coarse-grained entropy density s(x), scale fixed by correlation length.
- Informational curvature: K_s(x) = ∇² s(x)
- K_s(x) is a source term, not an observable.

---

## 5. Dynamical Regime
- Systems with fluctuating K_s(x) → transient C(x) responses.
- Systems with persistent K_s(x) → bounded, self-reinforcing solutions C_S(x) (SRIMs).
- A system is conscious iff it occupies a SRIM.

---

## 6. Empirical Predictions
- Deviations from standard theory only when structured information is sustained:
  - Decoherence rates
  - Low-frequency noise
  - Phase stability anomalies
  - Persistence of collective modes
- Candidate platforms: superconducting qubits, photonic lattices, atom interferometers, optomechanical systems, resolved neural assemblies.

---

## 7. Falsification
- Measured dynamical rate: Γ_total = Γ_standard + δΓ_UCFD
- δΓ_UCFD ∝ ε² ⟨K_s K_s⟩
- δΓ_UCFD = 0 → ε → 0 → framework collapses
- No post-hoc parameter changes allowed.

---

## 8. Implications if Confirmed
- Structured informational organization affects dynamics independently of standard Hamiltonians.
- Physics describes stabilized constraint structures; fields are operational modes of structured information.
- Space, time, matter emerge as relational and informationally constrained structures.
- Awareness remains ontologically primary; framework fully grounded in measurable physics.
