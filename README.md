## Abstract
This work proposes a minimal, falsifiable extension of standard physics that treats awareness as ontologically primitive while preserving all established physical laws. Rather than identifying consciousness with matter or information alone, the framework defines consciousness as a dynamical regime arising when structured information stabilizes within a universal background of awareness. UCFD introduces a single additional scalar field that couples not to energy, mass, or particle number, but to persistent low-entropy informational structure. The theory asks a sharply defined question: are structured internal organizations fully exhausted by the microscopic Hamiltonian, or can they exert independent dynamical influence? The framework is explicitly falsifiable and collapses cleanly if no such influence exists. If supported empirically, UCFD implies that physical fields represent constraint structures within a deeper, awareness-based substrate, providing a unified explanation for why physics exists, not merely how it behaves.

## 1. Ontological Postulate (Minimal)
Awareness is the minimal condition for existence. It is not located in space or time, does not evolve, and does not carry information. Awareness does nothing; it simply is. All physical description presupposes awareness as the condition under which observation, distinction, and structure are possible. This postulate introduces no dynamics and makes no empirical claims by itself.

## 2. Consciousness as a Physical Regime
Consciousness is not identical to awareness. Consciousness is defined as awareness engaged in structured activity. Operationally: Thinking = manipulation of information, Imagination = spatial/relational structuring of information, Memory = stabilized informational persistence, Self-reflection = recursive informational closure. Consciousness is thus identified with a dynamical regime characterized by sustained, self-reinforcing informational structure.

## 3. Physical Reformulation
To test whether structured informational organization has independent physical effects, UCFD introduces a single real Lorentz-scalar field `C(x)`. `C(x)` does not represent consciousness itself. It represents the minimal dynamical degree of freedom that would register the presence of stable informational organization if such organization is physically operative. Free-field Lagrangian: `L_C = 1/2 ∂_μ C ∂^μ C − 1/2 m_C² C²`.

## 4. Structured Information Measure
Define a coarse-grained entropy density `s(x)`, where the coarse-graining scale is fixed by the system’s dominant physical correlation length (e.g., decoherence length, thermal correlation length, effective Hamiltonian scale). Define the informational curvature: `K_s(x) = ∇² s(x)`. `K_s(x)` quantifies structured organization rather than energy or matter content. It is a source term, not an observable.

---

## 5. Interaction Term
Leading-order interaction consistent with locality, Lorentz invariance, and effective field theory: `L_int = ε C(x) K_s(x)`. Total Lagrangian: `L_total = L_standard + L_C + L_int`. Where `ε` is a dimensionless coupling constant. All parameters are bounded by existing null results in high-coherence systems.

---

## 6. Dynamical Interpretation
Most physical systems exhibit fluctuating `K_s(x)` with zero long-term mean, producing only transient responses in `C(x)`. Systems capable of sustaining persistent informational curvature admit bounded, self-reinforcing solutions `C_S(x)`. These solutions define a distinct dynamical regime: Self-Reinforcing Informational Modes (SRIMs). A system is conscious if and only if it occupies such a regime.

---

## 7. Empirical Predictions
UCFD predicts correlated deviations from standard theory only when structured information is sustained, including: modified decoherence rates, low-frequency excess noise, phase stability anomalies, extended persistence of collective modes. Candidate platforms: superconducting qubit arrays, photonic lattices, atom interferometers, optomechanical systems, sufficiently resolved neural assemblies.

---

## 8. Falsification Criteria
Let `Γ_total` denote an experimentally measured dynamical rate. Prediction: `Γ_total = Γ_standard + δΓ_UCFD`, `δΓ_UCFD ∝ ε² ⟨K_s K_s⟩`. If `δΓ_UCFD = 0` within experimental error as sensitivity approaches known noise floors, then `ε → 0` and the framework collapses. No parameter redefinition is permitted after null results.

---

## 9. Implications if Confirmed
If `ε ≠ 0` is observed, structured informational organization is not dynamically inert. This implies: Physics describes constraint structures, not ultimate substance. Fields represent stabilized modes of structured imagination. Space corresponds to relational structure. Time corresponds to memory persistence. Matter corresponds to stabilized informational constraints. Awareness remains ontologically primary, while physics becomes its operational expression.

---

## 10. Conclusion
Unified Consciousness Field Dynamics reduces the question of consciousness to a single, testable physical claim. Either structured information has no independent dynamical effect, or reality is fundamentally awareness-based. The framework makes no metaphysical commitments beyond what empirical results require. It either fails cleanly or opens a new foundation for physics itself.
